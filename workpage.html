   			<h2>Gannon's Bio</h2>
   			<p class="bbelow clearfix">I am seventeen and currently still in high school. This is my senior year and I am very much looking forward to wrapping up the year. I plan on attending Montreat College in North Carolina for basketball hopefully. I plan on majoring in cyber security with a possible minor in bussiness management. My free time mostly consists of playing basketball because it is what I love to do. My hobbies also include hiking, playing video games, or just basically relaxing in general.</p>
